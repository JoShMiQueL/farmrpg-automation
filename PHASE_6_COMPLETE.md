# Phase 6: DevOps & Monitoring - Completion Report

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Health Check Endpoints
Created `HealthController` with 3 endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/health` - Basic health check with uptime
- ✅ `GET /api/health/ready` - Readiness probe for K8s/Docker
- ✅ `GET /api/health/live` - Liveness probe for K8s/Docker

### 2. CI/CD Improvements
Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
- ✅ Added client build verification job
- ✅ Updated all-checks-passed to include build
- ✅ Ensures client builds successfully in CI
- ✅ All 4 jobs must pass (lint, typecheck, test, build)

### 3. Package Scripts
Enhanced root `package.json` scripts:
- ✅ `dev:bot` - Run bot in development mode
- ✅ `start:bot` - Run fishing bot in production
- ✅ `test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- ✅ `typecheck:all` - Type check all packages

### 4. Environment Validation Fix
Fixed CI test failures:
- ✅ Made `FARMRPG_COOKIE` optional in test environment
- ✅ Auto-provides test default when `NODE_ENV=test`
- ✅ Prevents ZodError in CI without secrets
- ✅ All 68 tests now pass in CI

### 5. Final Documentation
- ✅ Updated main README with new architecture
- ✅ Created comprehensive deployment guide
- ✅ Documented all health check endpoints
- ✅ Added Docker deployment examples

## 🔧 Health Check Endpoints

### Basic Health
```bash
GET /api/health

Response:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T18:45:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

### Readiness Probe
```bash
GET /api/health/ready

Response:
{
  "status": "ready",
  "checks": {
    "server": true
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T18:45:00.000Z"
}
```

### Liveness Probe
```bash
GET /api/health/live

Response:
{
  "status": "alive",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T18:45:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🐳 Kubernetes Integration

### Deployment YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: farmrpg-server
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: server
        image: farmrpg-server:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /api/health/live
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /api/health/ready
            port: 3000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
```

## ✅ Quality Checks

- ✅ `bun run check` - All files formatted
- ✅ `bun run test` - All 68 tests passing
- ✅ `bun run build` - Client builds successfully
- ✅ Health endpoints working
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline updated
- ✅ Environment validation fixed

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### CI Test Failures
**Problem**: Tests failing in CI with `ZodError: FARMRPG_COOKIE Required`

**Root Cause**: Environment validation was too strict, requiring `FARMRPG_COOKIE` even in test environment

**Solution**: 
- Made `FARMRPG_COOKIE` optional in Zod schema
- Auto-provide test default when `NODE_ENV=test`
- Maintains strict validation in production/development

**Result**: All 68 tests now pass in CI ✅
